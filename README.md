# Reminder
Simple Reminder Desktop App

You only need to enter what you want your program to reminds you when you open it. TO ADD DUE DATES AFTER YOU TYPE YOUR TASK PRESS ENTER AND ADD THE DATE. I didnt want it to be too crowded and complicated so i didnt add any calendar or another widget for you to enter. Just press enter and enter your due date.

I hope you enjoy :):):)
